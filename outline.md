## Introduction (400 words)

### Paragraph 1
* Body count statement
* Risk factors, including diet
* Long history and debate over value of fiber consumption
* In the colon, bacteria ferment fiber to produce a ton of SCFAs
* Because of this, SCFAs are all the rage in microbiome research
* In tissue culture and animal studies, SCFAs have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, which is hypothesized to be a primary mechanism driving tumorigenesis.

### Paragraph 2
* All of this would implicate bacterial component
* In animal models, bacteria have been shown to have a role in tumorigenesis
* In animal models, mice with fewer bacteria that are associated with SCFAs produce more tumors
* It is possible to distinguish variation in colon health in humans based on the microbiome
* The current study compares the SCFA profile and microbiome community and genomic structure with variation in colon health


## Results (700 words)
* There is no association between presence of tumors and SCFA concentration
	- Wilcoxon/T-test
	- Cross sectional
	- Aggregating SCFAs does not improve association with CRC
	- Combining 16S and SCFA does not improve prediction of CRC
	- Lack of change pre and post treatment
* Community structure is not predictive of SCFA production
	- Random forest regression
	- 16S
	- picrust
	- shotgun metagenomic data


## Conclusion (200 words)
* Unlikely that SCFAs are the primary mechanism that limits tumorigenesis
* Limitations
	- Observing the community once the tumor is developed
	- Not looking at mucosal communities
* Need to identify other possible mechanisms that drive and prevent tumorigenesis
* Supports evidence that fiber consumption has a null effect on tumorigenesis
