# TO DO LIST
### Create three different linear regressions
    ### One for each standard (x = concentration, y = Area)
### Convert each standard based on unique model obtained
### Create correction based on location run
### Correct concentration based on location of sample relative to three different standards used
    ### e.g. use std 1 and 2 if samples between them and std 2 and 3 if samples between them (mM)
### Convert to mmol/kg based on weight measured and total volume originally suspended in
